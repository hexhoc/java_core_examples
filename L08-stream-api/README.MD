# Stream API

## Description

To start learning the Java Stream API, let's analyze the basic definitions. The Java language has the concept of
streams, but neither the classes InputStream (input stream) and OutputStream (output stream), nor Thread (
execution stream) have anything to do with the innovation of the Java 8 â€” Stream API. The Stream API does not work with a
stream in the literal sense of the word, but with a chain of functions called from themselves. It provides
functional programming in Java 8. A stream is a sequence of elements and functions
that support various types of operations.
